# Christine's Notes — PDF study-notes generator

Generates printable, ADHD-friendly study notes from **Christine's Notes design system**. The system has
bright Material chapter colors, pastel fills with dark ink, Merriweather / Lexend / Fira Code type, and KaTeX
math. A notes packet is written as a small React file of page templates and components and rendered to a
US Letter PDF that mixes portrait and landscape pages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris93007-wq/study-notes
cd study-notes
npm install
npm run dev                        # live preview at http://localhost:5173 (pick a document)
npm run pdf                        # build + render every notes/*.tsx → out/*.pdf
npm run pdf -- week-03             # just the matching document(s)
npm run skill:zip                  # build the Claude desktop-app skill zip
npm run new -- week-04-segmentation "Segmentation"   # start a new packet from the template
npm run typecheck
```

`npm run pdf` needs Chromium or Google Chrome. It uses `$CHROMIUM_PATH`, then a Playwright-managed Chromium,
then an installed Chrome. Fonts and KaTeX are bundled, so rendering works offline.

## Use it in the Claude desktop app (chat and Cowork)

The repo packages itself as a **skill**: one zip containing a `SKILL.md` plus the whole generator. Once uploaded, you can ask Claude for notes (or type `/christines-notes`) and it writes the packet and runs `npm run pdf` for you.

**1. Build the zip** (on your computer, from the cloned repo):

```bash
npm install            # first time only
npm run skill:zip      # → skill-dist/christines-notes.zip
```

(`zip` must be on your PATH. It is on macOS and Linux by default.) Rebuild the zip any time you change the generator, components or notes, then re-upload it.

**2. Upload it** in the Claude desktop app:

1. Open **Settings → Capabilities → Skills**. The menu name can differ a little between app versions.
2. Use the upload option there (an upload or “+” button; the exact label varies) and select `skill-dist/christines-notes.zip`. Upload the **zip itself**, not the unzipped folder.
3. Make sure the skill is switched **on**. If a `christines-notes` skill is already listed, remove it or replace it with the new upload.

**3. Use it:** in Claude chat or Cowork, say something like *“Make a Week 4 packet on customer segmentation from these slides”* or type `/christines-notes`. Claude writes `notes/<name>.tsx`, runs `npm run pdf`, and hands you `out/<name>.pdf`. In Cowork, pick the folder you want the PDF saved to.

**What the app's environment needs:** Node 18 or newer, access to the npm registry (for `npm install`), and a Chromium or Chrome browser for the PDF step. If any of these is missing, the skill tells you, still writes the `.tsx` notes file, and you render it on your computer with `npm run pdf`. It never claims to have made a PDF it didn't.

**Claude Code instead?** Start a session in this repo. `.claude/skills/christines-notes` loads automatically; run `/christines-notes`.

## How printing works

- Page geometry is real print CSS. `@page` sets US Letter with 0.5in margins. Named pages (`landscape`,
  `portrait-bare`, `cover`) switch orientation and footers per template.
- The footer (breadcrumb + `page / total`) is drawn in `@page` margin boxes, so it repeats on every printed
  sheet with correct numbers.
- Content flows across sheets. Cards, callouts, table rows and diagrams avoid splitting.
- On screen each template is drawn as a sheet, so the preview matches the printable width exactly.
  Browser *Print → Save as PDF* gives the same result as `npm run pdf`, except that Contents page numbers
  only come from `npm run pdf`.
